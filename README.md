# Learning how to use PyTorch for bulding Deep learning models

This repository brings a basic introduction to PyTorch, covering tensors (which are the main data structure of PyTorch), the module autograd (that PyTorch uses to calculate gradients for training neural networks), validation and trasfer learning.

In the notebooks I will be working step by step over each concept and practicing its correspondent implementation.
